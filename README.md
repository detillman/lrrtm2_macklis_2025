Scripts for investigation of growth cone proteomes non-canonically regulating precise circuit formation in vivo: quantification of subcellular proteomes, validation of candidate growth cone proteins, identification of functions in circuit formation, elucidation of molecular mechanisms, development of improved subcellular approaches

All raw data and processed files are available on the Harvard Dataverse: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/KZ2JDL.
